1. The console will log the number of prices that were inputted, since the for loop will have run once for each inputted price. In this case it is 3.
2. The console will log the discounted (but not rounded) version of the last price that was inputted, since that's the last price to be processed by the for loop that precedes this line. In this case it is 150.
3. The console will log the discounted AND rounded version of the last price that was inputted, since that's the last price to be processed by the for loop that precedes this line. In this case it is 150.
4. It will return an array of each individual price after discounts have been applied. In this case it will return [50, 100, 150].
5. There will be an error because 'i' is a let and cannot be accessed outside the for loop where it was defined.
6. There will be an error because 'discountedPrice' is a let and cannot be accessed outside the for loop where it was defined.
7. The console will log the discounted AND rounded version of the last price that was inputted, since that's the last price to be processed by the for loop that precedes this line. In this case it is 150.
8. It will return an array of each individual price after discounts have been applied. In this case it will return [50, 100, 150].
9. There will be an error because 'i' is a let and cannot be accessed outside the for loop where it was defined.
10. The length of prices, or the number of prices that were inputted, will be logged. In this case it is 3.
11.  It will return an array of each individual price after discounts have been applied. In this case it will return [50, 100, 150].
