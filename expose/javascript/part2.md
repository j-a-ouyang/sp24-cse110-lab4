1. The console will log the number of prices that were inputted, since the for loop will have run once for each inputted price. In this case it is 3.
2. The console will log the discounted (but not rounded) version of the last price that was inputted, since that's the last price to be processed by the for loop that precedes this line. In this case it is 150.
3. The console will log the discounted AND rounded version of the last price that was inputted, since that's the last price to be processed by the for loop that precedes this line. In this case it is 150.
4. It will return an array of each individual price after discounts have been applied. In this case it will return [50, 100, 150].
5. There will be an error because 'i' is a let and cannot be accessed outside the for loop where it was defined.
6. There will be an error because 'discountedPrice' is a let and cannot be accessed outside the for loop where it was defined.
7. The console will log the discounted AND rounded version of the last price that was inputted, since that's the last price to be processed by the for loop that precedes this line. In this case it is 150.
8. It will return an array of each individual price after discounts have been applied. In this case it will return [50, 100, 150].
9. There will be an error because 'i' is a let and cannot be accessed outside the for loop where it was defined.
10. The length of prices, or the number of prices that were inputted, will be logged. In this case it is 3.
11.  It will return an array of each individual price after discounts have been applied. In this case it will return [50, 100, 150].
12A. student.name
12B. student['Grad Year']
12C. student.greeting()
12D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
12E. student.courseLoad[0]
13A. "32" (Adding a string and a number creates a string)
13B. 1 (Subtracting a string and a number creates a number if the string is a number)
13C. 3 (null counts as 0 in math equations)
13D. "3null" (null counts as the string "null" when affixed to a string)
13E. 4 (true counts as 1 in math equations)
13F. 0 (false and null both count as 0 in math equations)
13G. "3undefined" (undefined counts as the string 'undefined' when affixed to a string)
13H. NaN (subtraction is always treated as a mathematical equation and undefined does not convert to a number)
14A. true ('2' is converted to the number 2)
14B. false (dictionary comparison: 1 comes before 2 alphabetically)
14C. true ('2' is converted to the number 2)
14D. false (=== does not perform any conversions)
14E. false (true converts to the number 1)
14F. true (2 is not equal to 0, so Boolean(2) returns true)
15. The == operator converts two variables to numbers before comparisons. The === operator doesn't.
17. The function returns [2, 4, 6]. This is because it calls doSomething on each element of the array, and doSomething multiplies them by 2. They all get added to a new array.
18. This will immediately print 1, then 3, then 4. After 1 second it will print 2.
